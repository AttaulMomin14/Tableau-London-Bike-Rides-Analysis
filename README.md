**Detailed Description**

In this Tableau project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of London bike rides data, beginning with the download of the dataset using the Kaggle API in Python. This ensured that the latest and most comprehensive data was used for the analysis.

**Steps Involved:**

**Data Download:**
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, ensuring that the data was up-to-date and comprehensive. Python was used to handle the API interactions and manage the dataset download.

KPI Visual:
A KPI visual was created to display the total number of bike rides within a selected period. Users could select the period using a slicer, allowing for flexible and dynamic time-based analysis. This visual provided a quick and easy-to-understand summary of bike usage trends.

**Correlation Chart:**
The correlation chart illustrated the relationship between the number of bike rides and weather variables, specifically temperature and wind speed. Temperature was plotted on one axis, wind speed on another, and the number of rides was represented through the size or color of the data points. This visualization helped identify how weather conditions influenced the frequency of bike rides.

**Dynamic Line Chart with Moving Average:**
A line chart was designed to display the moving average of bike rides, with parameters enabling users to select the aggregation period (day, week, or month) and the duration (number of days, weeks, or months). This dynamic feature allowed users to smooth out fluctuations and observe longer-term trends in bike ride data.
An additional feature highlighted specific segments of the line chart based on the period selected from the slicer, making it easier to focus on and analyze particular time intervals within the overall trend.

**Interactivity and Customization:**
The project incorporated slicers and parameters to provide a high level of interactivity. Users could filter data, adjust time periods, and customize the moving average calculations, facilitating deep and flexible data exploration.
Highlighted segments in the line chart drew attention to the selected periods, enhancing the user experience by making the analysis more intuitive and focused.

By combining data downloading, processing, and advanced visualization techniques, this project demonstrated the power of integrating Python and Tableau for comprehensive data analysis. The interactive and customizable elements of the dashboard provided valuable insights into London bike ride patterns and the factors influencing them.
